## 5 months Master Thesis :
Apr. 2024 - Aug. 2024
I am currently doing a five-month internship at the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zurich as an ETH Zurich student. My research focuses on artificial neurogenesis in the context of hardware-constrained continual learning. Specifically, my team previously developed a neuromorphic hardware chip called MOSAIC for in-memory computing. I am now investigating the development of a neurogenesis approach to continual learning, which we plan to implement on our MOSAIC architecture.
