## Research Internship :
5 months - Apr. 2024 - Aug. 2024
I am currently doing a five-month internship at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/EIS/Research.html) in Zurich as an ETH Zurich student. My research focuses on artificial neurogenesis in the context of hardware-constrained continual learning. Specifically, my team previously developed a neuromorphic hardware chip called MOSAIC for in-memory computing. I am now investigating the development of a neurogenesis approach to continual learning, which we plan to implement on our MOSAIC architecture.

## Research Internship :
3 months - May 2023 - Jul 2023
In-depth investigation of Domain Adversarial Neural Networks and refinement of the most meaningful architecture to deal with highly imbalanced High Energy Physics datasets. 
Improved Domain Adversarial Neural NEtworks by overcoming inherent limitations, after producing a comparative review of several architectures.

## Research Project :
6 months - Oct. 2022 - Mar. 2023

Creation of an AI toy challenge for the [Fair Universe](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/) project, which aims at adressing systematic uncertainty in highly imbalanced High Energy Physics datasets.

Led a team of 4 in the conception of an AI toy challenge and the exploration of baseline methods, which has been solved by students from a class of 20.

preliminary exploration of possible baselines for to approach [Fair Universe](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/) problem, including MTE et Domain Adversarial Neural Networks.
