## AI Scientist Intern
4 months<br>
May. 2025 - Aug. 2025
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>Contributed to the development of <a href="https://www.neuralk-ai.com/">Neuralk AI</a>â€™s Tabular Foundation Model (NICL) by improving upon state-of-the-art synthetic data generators and building a flexible library to optimize them. These generators produce the synthetic data used to pretrain NICL and play a key role in enabling the model to generalize across diverse tabular data use cases, powering high-impact enterprise applications in commerce and beyond.</p>

## Research Internship
5 months<br>
Apr. 2024 - Aug. 2024

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>I've done a five-month internship at the <a href="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/EIS/Research.html">Institute of Neuroinformatics</a> in Zurich as an ETH Zurich student. My research focuses on artificial neurogenesis in the context of hardware-constrained continual learning. Specifically, my team previously developed a neuromorphic hardware chip called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44365-x">MOSAIC</a> for in-memory computing. I am now investigating the development of a neurogenesis approach to continual learning, which we plan to implement on our MOSAIC chip.</p>

## Research Internship
3 months<br>
May 2023 - Jul 2023

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>The goal of this research internship was to delve deeper into research project below.
    <br><br>
    I conducted an in-depth investigation of Domain Adversarial Neural Networks, including a comparative review of various architectures and the refinement of the most relevant one to deal with highly imbalanced High Energy Physics datasets. More precisely, I embedded the domain information of each sample into the input space, which enabled the model greater flexibility in building the decision boundary.</p>

## Research Project
6 months<br>
Oct. 2022 - Mar. 2023

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>The <a href="https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/">Fair Universe</a> project primarily aims at mitigating systematic uncertainty in High Energy Physics through the elaboration of machine learning challenges.
    <br><br>
    I have been involved in this project part-time for a preliminary exploration of baselines to tackle systematic uncertainty. Additionnaly, I have been leading a team of 4 in the conception of a machine learning challenge which has been solved by students from a class of 20.</p>
