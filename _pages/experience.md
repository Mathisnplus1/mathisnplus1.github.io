## Research Internship
5 months<br>
Apr. 2024 - present

I am currently doing a five-month internship at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/EIS/Research.html) in Zurich as an ETH Zurich student. My research focuses on artificial neurogenesis in the context of hardware-constrained continual learning. Specifically, my team previously developed a neuromorphic hardware chip called [MOSAIC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44365-x) for in-memory computing. I am now investigating the development of a neurogenesis approach to continual learning, which we plan to implement on our MOSAIC architecture.

## Research Internship
3 months<br>
May 2023 - Jul 2023

The goal of this research internship was to delve deeper into research project below.

I conducted an in-depth investigation of Domain Adversarial Neural Networks, including a comparative review of various architectures and the refinement of the most relevant one to deal with highly imbalanced High Energy Physics datasets. More precisely, I embedded the domain information of each sample into the input space, which enabled the model greater flexibility in building the decision boundary.

## Research Project
6 months<br>
Oct. 2022 - Mar. 2023

The [Fair Universe](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/) project primarily aims at mitigating systematic uncertainty in High Energy Physics through the elaboration of machine learning challenges.

I have been involved in this project part-time for a preliminary exploration of baselines to tackle systematic uncertainty. Additionnaly, I have been leading a team of 4 in the conception of an machine learning toy challenge which has been solved by students from a class of 20.
